# Wireless Architectures

Understanding different wireless network architectures is crucial for designing, deploying, and managing Wi-Fi networks effectively. These architectures dictate how Access Points (APs) are configured, controlled, and how client traffic is handled.

### 1. Autonomous AP Architecture (Fat AP / Standalone AP)

* **Concept:** Each Access Point is a self-contained unit that handles all wireless functions independently. It has its own operating system, web interface, and configurations (SSIDs, security, VLANs, radio settings).
* **How it works:**
    * Each AP is configured individually.
    * It performs all MAC layer functions, authentication (if local), encryption, and data forwarding.
    * Client traffic typically exits directly from the AP onto the wired network (often via a trunk port carrying multiple VLANs).
* **Advantages:**
    * Simple to deploy for small networks (1-5 APs).
    * No need for a central controller.
    * Lower initial cost per AP.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * Difficult to scale beyond a few APs (configuration becomes manual and time-consuming).
    * No centralized management, monitoring, or troubleshooting.
    * Limited mobility/roaming support (roaming depends entirely on client behavior, no network assistance).
    * No centralized RF management (channel and power assignment).
* **Best Use Cases:** Small offices, homes, very small retail stores.

### 2. Centralized (Controller-Based) AP Architecture (Thin AP / Controller-Managed AP)

* **Concept:** Access Points (often called "Thin APs" or "Lightweight APs") do not operate independently. They rely on a central Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) for configuration, management, and often for centralized data forwarding.
* **How it works:**
    * Thin APs discover and establish a secure tunnel (e.g., CAPWAP - Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points) to the WLC.
    * The WLC pushes configurations (SSIDs, security, VLAN mappings, radio settings) to all managed APs.
    * The WLC handles centralized functions like:
        * **Authentication:** Often integrates with RADIUS/AAA servers on behalf of the APs.
        * **Mobility/Roaming:** Manages Layer 2 and Layer 3 roaming for clients across APs managed by the same or different WLCs (via mobility groups/anchors).
        * **RF Management:** Dynamically adjusts AP channels and power levels to optimize coverage and minimize interference.
        * **Security:** Centralized rogue AP detection, intrusion prevention.
        * **Monitoring & Troubleshooting:** Provides a single pane of glass for network status, client connections, and events.
    * **Data Forwarding:**
        * **Centralized Forwarding:** All client data traffic is tunneled back to the WLC, which then forwards it onto the wired network. This is common for security policies or guest networks where all traffic needs to be inspected.
        * **Local Forwarding (FlexConnect/Direct Connect):** Client data traffic is sent directly from the AP to the local wired network, bypassing the WLC for data forwarding. This is efficient for large branch offices where tunneling all traffic back to a central WLC is inefficient. Control plane traffic still goes to the WLC.
* **Advantages:**
    * Centralized management and configuration, simplifying large deployments.
    * Enhanced mobility/seamless roaming.
    * Automated RF management and optimization.
    * Stronger centralized security features.
    * Improved troubleshooting and visibility.
* **Disadvantages:**
    * Higher initial cost due to the WLC hardware/software.
    * WLC can be a single point of failure (requires redundancy).
    * Potential for latency if all traffic is centralized over WAN links.
* **Best Use Cases:** Enterprise networks, universities, large venues, multi-building campuses.

### 3. Cloud-Managed Wireless Architecture

* **Concept:** Access Points are managed entirely from a cloud-based platform. There is no on-premise hardware controller. The management plane resides in the cloud, while the data plane typically remains local at the AP.
* **How it works:**
    * APs connect to the cloud management platform over the internet.
    * All configuration, monitoring, firmware updates, and analytics are handled via a web browser on the cloud dashboard.
    * Client data traffic is usually forwarded locally from the AP to the wired network (like local forwarding in controller-based systems), maximizing efficiency and minimizing internet bandwidth usage. Some solutions offer optional tunneling to a cloud gateway for specific services (e.g., VPN).
    * Features like RF optimization, client analytics, and security policies are managed centrally in the cloud and pushed to the APs.
* **Advantages:**
    * Extreme scalability (from small sites to thousands of APs globally).
    * Reduced on-premise hardware and maintenance costs.
    * Simplified deployment and management via a web interface.
    * Automatic firmware updates and feature rollouts.
    * Enhanced analytics and insights available from the cloud.
    * Often highly resilient (cloud platform typically has high availability).
* **Disadvantages:**
    * Reliance on internet connectivity for management (though APs continue to function locally if the internet goes down).
    * Subscription-based licensing model.
    * Potential concerns about data privacy and control for some organizations (though robust security measures are in place).
* **Best Use Cases:** Distributed enterprises with many branch offices, retail chains, K-12 education, small-to-medium businesses (SMBs), organizations looking for simplicity and scalability (like environments using **Shasta.cloud**).

### 4. Mesh Networking (Wireless Mesh)

* **Concept:** A subset of wireless architecture where APs connect wirelessly to each other to extend network coverage without needing a wired Ethernet connection to every AP. Some APs act as "mesh portals" (connected to wired network), others as "mesh points" (wireless backhaul).
* **How it works:**
    * APs form a self-configuring, self-healing wireless
