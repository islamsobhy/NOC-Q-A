# 802.1X and RADIUS: A Powerful Partnership for Network Access Control

**802.1X** and **RADIUS** are often mentioned together because they work hand-in-hand to provide robust network access control.

## Understanding Their Relationship

* **802.1X:**
    * Is a standard for **Port-Based Network Access Control (PNAC)**.
    * It defines a framework for authenticating devices connected to a wired or wireless LAN port *before* allowing them to access the network.
    * Think of 802.1X as the **gatekeeper** at the entrance of your network.

* **RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service):**
    * Is a **protocol** that implements the **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)** framework.
    * It's the "engine" that performs the actual authentication and authorization decisions for 802.1X.

**In essence, 802.1X is the "how" (the mechanism for controlling access at the port level), and RADIUS is the "who, what, and where" (the system that verifies identity, grants permissions, and logs activities).**

## How They Interact: The Workflow

The interaction between 802.1X and RADIUS involves three key players:

1.  **The Player (Supplicant):**
    * This is the end device (e.g., a laptop, smartphone, printer) trying to connect to the network.
    * It has 802.1X client software (often built into the operating system).

2.  **The Gatekeeper (Authenticator):**
    * This is the network device controlling access, such as a Wi-Fi access point (AP) or an Ethernet switch.
    * It implements the 802.1X standard.

3.  **The Security Guard (Authentication Server - usually a RADIUS Server):**
    * This is the centralized server that holds user credentials and access policies.

### The Workflow Steps:

1.  When a supplicant (your device) tries to connect to an 802.1X-enabled port on an authenticator (AP/switch), the port is initially in an "unauthorized" state. This state only allows 802.1X authentication traffic (EAP over LAN - EAPOL).
2.  The authenticator (AP/switch) acts as a proxy, forwarding authentication requests from the supplicant to the RADIUS server.
3.  The RADIUS server receives the request, authenticates the user/device against its database (or an external directory like Active Directory), and then authorizes access based on predefined policies.
4.  The RADIUS server sends an `Access-Accept` or `Access-Reject` message back to the authenticator.
5.  If `Access-Accept`, the authenticator opens the port, allowing full network access to the supplicant. If `Access-Reject`, the port remains unauthorized, blocking network access.
6.  The RADIUS server also handles accounting, logging the connection details (who, when, for how long, what resources were used).

## Why They Need Each Other

* **Without 802.1X, RADIUS wouldn't have a standardized way to enforce port-level access control.** Any device could connect to a port, and then RADIUS would only come into play for specific application-level authentication.
* **Without RADIUS, 802.1X would lack a centralized, scalable mechanism for user authentication and authorization.** Each AP or switch would need to manage its own user database, which is impractical in larger networks.

In essence, 802.1X provides the framework for port-based access control, and RADIUS provides the backend intelligence for performing the actual authentication, authorization, and accounting. This combination creates a robust and scalable solution for securing network access in enterprise and public environments (like WPA2/3-Enterprise Wi-Fi).
